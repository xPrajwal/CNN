Facial age estimation has been a complex task in the field of computer vision due to the factors such as variations in the facial appearance, complex aging pattern and the lack of a standard knowledge as to the basis of what really constitutes towards calculating the age using facial features. With the ever improving technology, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proven to be the most powerful solution the facial age estimation problem. We aslo need to note that the performance of these models heavily depend on the the quality of the images that they are trained on. Fortunately, certain pre-processing techniques in the field have shown that they can improve the performance of these models by enhancing certain features in a photo. In this research paper, we try to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of various, commonly used pre-processing techniques in the computer vision field over the performance of a CNN-based facial age estimation model. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of Image Rescaling, Histogram Equalization, Gaussian smoothing, and Grayscale conversion techniques on three widely used datasets, namely UTKFace, MegaAge, and FGNet. Our experimental results indicate that preprocessing techniques have a significant impact on the performance of the age estimation model. Among the techniques studied, Histogram Equalization is found to be the most effective in improving the accuracy of the model on all three datasets. and Gaussian smoothing and Image Rescaling techniques come close to the positive impact of Histogram Equalization but just fall short. Image Rescaling was successful only on the FGNet dataset. Although it didn't show a significant improvement in the performance of the model, it improved its time and memory used during the compilation. Furthermore, it was noticed that the impact of these pre-processing techniques varied depending on the dataset being considered. For instance, the Histogram Equalization technique is found to be most effective on UTKFace. Whereas, Image Rescaling came out on top for the FGNet datasets and Gaussian smoothing showed it is most effective on the MegaAge dataset. The findings in our work contain important comparisons for the researchers in the field of computer vision especially in the field of facial age estimation. This work will give them an idea and guidance towards picking the best pre-processing techniques to enhance the quality of the images for the specific dataset they're using enabling them to extract the maximum potential of the the age estimation they're using.
